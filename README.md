# text-sentiment-analysis

## Use Cases
This project uses machine learning models for natural language processing and classifying texts according to their implied biases (ranging from ```-1``` for very negative, to ```1``` for very positive; ```0``` is neutral). The model analyzes linguistic properties such as loaded language, word choice, etc. to determine how positive, negative, or neutral a text (such as a web article or an Amazon review) is.

## Project Directory
This model can be used on prewritten articles on the web ```src/analysisModel/analysisModel.py```, or your own personal import ```src/tester/modelTest.py```. 

To import or write your own text for testing the model's accuracy, go to ```src/tester/myText.txt```.
